# Documentation folder #

This folder contains the documents relating to modelling Winter Wren populations.

 - The [Images folder](https://github.com/EdDataScienceEES/challenge-3-nicolelikesharks/tree/master/Documentation/Images) contains extra pictures to be used in the [Summary report](https://github.com/EdDataScienceEES/challenge-3-nicolelikesharks/blob/master/Documentation/summary_report_winterwren.md), which aren't included in the [Output folder](https://github.com/EdDataScienceEES/challenge-3-nicolelikesharks/tree/master/Output) folder

 - The [Pre-registration](https://github.com/EdDataScienceEES/challenge-3-nicolelikesharks/blob/master/Documentation/WWF_pregistration_Nicole.md) includes the initial research plan for the study, including the overall study aims, proposed hypotheses and methods as well as where the [Data](https://github.com/EdDataScienceEES/challenge-3-nicolelikesharks/tree/master/data) can be [accessed]( (http://www.livingplanetindex.org/home/index). Part of the reason to include a pre-registration is to prevent HARKING (i.e hypothesizing after the results are known) and p-hacking by declaring hypotheses and methods before the experiments are conducted. Pre-registration also encourages transparent and open science practices. 

 - The [summary_report_winterwren](https://github.com/EdDataScienceEES/challenge-3-nicolelikesharks/blob/master/Documentation/summary_report_winterwren.md) file is the main summary report for the study, in Markdown(.md) format
