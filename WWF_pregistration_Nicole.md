Aim of this study:
To assess and compare the population trends of winter wren populations in Canada across different locations from 1970-2010.  

Research question and hypotheses: 
Question: What is the population trend for winter wrens in Canada from 1970-2010? 
Hypothesis: The populations of winter wrens change over time, exhibiting a trend that could be positive or negative. 
Null Hypothesis: The populations of winter wrens do not show any clear trends. 


Description of variables: 
Dependent/response variables: Population of winter wrens measured through the "Annual index". 
Independent/ explanatory variable: Years from 1970-2010. 


Spatial and temporal structures to data that need to be considered: 
Spatial: This report focuses on the winter wren populations in Canada. Within Cananda, there are 8 locations: Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brutswick, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia & Prince Edward Island, Ontario, Saskatchewan, Quebec. 

Temporal: Temporal data available for this report exists from 1970-2010. 

Overall sample size: 425 measurements across the 8 locations over 1970-2010. 

Analyses conducted to examine the main questions and to test hypothesis: 

A general linear mixed model will be used (poisson) after transforming non-integer values (Annual Index) to integers.
