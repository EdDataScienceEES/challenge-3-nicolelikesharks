This folder contains all the R script files related to the statistical modelling

The given starter script [challenge3_starter_script.R](https://github.com/EdDataScienceEES/challenge-3-nicolelikesharks/blob/master/script/challenge3_starter_script.R) was used to view al the unique species contained in our dataset. From there the Winter Wren was selected for further study.

The final script file [winterwren_model.R](https://github.com/EdDataScienceEES/challenge-3-nicolelikesharks/blob/master/script/winterwren_model.R) is a continuation of the starter script and includes all the necessary code used to tidy the LPI dataset , as well as the code used to construct our statistical model and output findings.
