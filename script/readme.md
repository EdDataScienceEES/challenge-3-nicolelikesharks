# Script folder #

This folder contains all the R script files related to the statistical modelling

 - The given starter script [challenge3_starter_script.R](https://github.com/EdDataScienceEES/challenge-3-nicolelikesharks/blob/master/script/challenge3_starter_script.R) was used to view al the unique species contained in our dataset. From there the Winter Wren was selected for further study.

 - The final script file [winterwren_model_script_nicole.R](https://github.com/EdDataScienceEES/challenge-3-nicolelikesharks/blob/master/script/winterwren_model_script_nicole.R) is a continuation of the starter script and includes all the necessary code used to tidy the LPI dataset , as well as the code used to construct our statistical model and output findings.

Both scripts make use of the LPI dataset available in the [Data](https://github.com/EdDataScienceEES/challenge-3-nicolelikesharks/tree/master/data) folder

All the outputs from the script can be found in the [Output](https://github.com/EdDataScienceEES/challenge-3-nicolelikesharks/tree/master/Output) folder and are also used in the final [summary report](https://github.com/EdDataScienceEES/challenge-3-nicolelikesharks/blob/master/Documentation/summary_report_winterwren.md)
